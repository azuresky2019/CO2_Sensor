hi Raju:
sample timing:     
1. we turn on the transmitter for 500 ms and then turn off for 4000ms.  The whole cycle is 4500ms.
2. After turn on transmitter , we will wait for 160ms for sensor warm up.
3.switch the amplifier to active channel and reference channel every 20ms.
4.During 20ms ,  do adc sample routine
5.The difference value of reference channel and active channel  stand for the level of co2 concentration
 
Because adc is very fast, i can not store the data so quickly. i need to do some optimize to the save the data. 
i will send you the data later. 
 
i'am always on skype, you can contact me at any time
