Raju, meet Guoxin You. He is working on the C02 sensor.
 
We would like to implement the FFT strategy on our C02 sensor project. It is not critical to use Matlab, any FFT routines will probably be fine.
 
We also need to add compensation for three different variables: temperature, humidity and pressure.
All of these sensors are present on our module. We don’t have data yet though, will be working on that soon.
 
 
Here is the basic concept of our sensor, its called a Non-dispersive Infra Red sensor.
Light/heat from a small infra red source (basically a little incandescent lamp) travels through air with C02 in it.
One detector has a filter set to let only one small band of light through, the band which matches the absorption of C02 gas.
The other has no filter, the difference in the two signals gives you the C02 concentration.
 
We have the basic sensing working, now we want to improve the accuracy.
